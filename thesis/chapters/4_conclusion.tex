\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}



From the perspective of feature work, we see an opportunity for possible research in converting the manual to the automatic selection of new prototypes for Prototyped Feature DTW and MPFDTW transformations. We tried multiple strategies based on the automatic selection by predicting the correlation of new prototypes or using the data density. None of our strategies provided significantly better results than the same amount of randomly selected prototypes, yet we still believe there is a strategy that will yield superior results.
