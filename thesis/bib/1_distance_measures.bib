    abstract = {In almost every scientific field, measurements are performed over time. These observations lead to a collection of organized data called time series. The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field.},

    abstract = {Many algorithms have been proposed for the problem of time series classification. However, it is clear that one-nearest-neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is exceptionally difficult to beat. This approach has one weakness, however; it is computationally too demanding for many realtime applications. One way to mitigate this problem is to speed up the DTW calculations. Nonetheless, there is a limit to how much this can help. In this work, we propose an additional technique, numerosity reduction, to speed up one-nearest-neighbor DTW. While the idea of numerosity reduction for nearest-neighbor classifiers has a long history, we show here that we can leverage off an original observation about the relationship between dataset size and DTW constraints to produce an extremely compact dataset with little or no loss in accuracy. We test our ideas with a comprehensive set of experiments, and show that it can efficiently produce extremely fast accurate classifiers.},

The problem of pairwise similarity of time series is based on the underlying distance measure (which is not necessarily metric or even dissimilarity measure) and is common in many time series areas. To the best of our knowledge, there are over 40 distance measures already proposed in the literature. Thus, there is a need to decide which measure will be the most appropriate for our specific problem. The aim of our study is to give a comprehensive comparison of distance measures for time series classification enriched with extensive statistical analysis. We will follow a methodology that assumes evaluating the efficacy of distance measures by the prism of accuracy of 1NN classifier. Experimental results carried out on benchmark datasets originated from UCR Time Series Classification Archive are provided. We show that none of the distance measures is the best for all datasets, however there is a group performing statistically significantly better than the others.",

This representation is interesting for its ability to use a dissimilarity measure to embed various patterns (e.g. graph patterns with different topology and temporal patterns with different lengths) into a vector space. The method proposed in this paper uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) based DSE for the purpose of the classification of massive sets of temporal patterns. However, using large data sets introduces the problem of requiring a high computational cost. To address this, we consider a prototype selection approach. A vector space created by DSE offers us the ability to treat its independent dimensions as features allowing for the use of feature selection. The proposed method exploits this and reduces the number of prototypes required for accurate classification. To validate the proposed method we use two-class classification on a data set of handwritten on-line numerical digits. We show that by using DSE with ensemble classification, high accuracy classification is possible with very few prototypes."

    abstract = {Existing studies on time series are based on two categories of distance functions. The first category consists of the Lp-norms. They are metric distance functions but cannot support local time shifting. The second category consists of distance functions which are capable of handling local time shifting but are nonmetric. The first contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new distance function, which we call ERP ("Edit distance with Real Penalty"). Representing a marriage of L1- norm and the edit distance, ERP can support local time shifting, and is a metric.The second contribution of the paper is the development of pruning strategies for large time series databases. Given that ERP is a metric, one way to prune is to apply the triangle inequality. Another way to prune is to develop a lower bound on the ERP distance. We propose such a lower bound, which has the nice computational property that it can be efficiently indexed with a standard B+- tree. Moreover, we show that these two ways of pruning can be used simultaneously for ERP distances. Specifically, the false positives obtained from the B+-tree can be further minimized by applying the triangle inequality. Based on extensive experimentation with existing benchmarks and techniques, we show that this combination delivers superb pruning power and search time performance, and dominates all existing strategies.},

The existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. Cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. In this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections. Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP), and Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS), indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclidean distance, DTW and ERP, and it is on average 50\% more accurate than LCSS. We also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of EDR and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. The experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.},

Aims:  To evaluate the clinical implications of tumour marker (α-fetoprotein) response in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with thalidomide treatment. Patients and methods:  Forty-two advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with baseline α-fetoprotein levels above 200 ng/mL and thalidomide therapy were included. Serum α-fetoprotein levels were measured every 4 weeks. α-fetoprotein response was defined as a 50\% or greater reduction of α-fetoprotein levels for 4 or more weeks during treatment. Radiographic response was assessed by World Health Organization criteria; survivals were estimated by Kaplan–Meier method and prognostic factors were assessed by Cox's proportional hazard model. Results:  With intention-to-treat analysis, radiographic response and α-fetoprotein response were obtained in 7\% (three of 42, 95\% confidence interval: 0–15) and 24\% (10 of 42, 95\% CI: 10–38) of patients, respectively. All radiographic response was observed in α-fetoprotein responders. Multivariate analyses showed α-fetoprotein response was independent prognostic factor for both progression-free survival (relative risk = 0.394, 95\% CI: 0.189–0.820, P = 0.013) and overall survival (relative risk = 0.241, 95\% CI: 0.096–0.606, P =0.003), whereas radiographic response was not. Conclusion:  α-fetoprotein response can more accurately reflect the biological response of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma to thalidomide therapy than radiographic response.},

%     abstract={Multivariate time series classification is of significance in machine learning area. In this paper, we present a novel time series classification algorithm, which adopts triangle distance function as similarity measure, extracts some meaningful patterns from original data and uses traditional machine learning algorithm to create classifier based on the extracted patterns. During the stage of pattern extraction, Gini function is used to determine the starting position in the original data and the length of each pattern. In order to improve computing efficiency, we also apply sampling method to reduce the searching space of patterns. The common datasets are used to check our algorithm and compare with the naive algorithms. Experimental results are shown to reveal that much improvement can be gained in terms of interpretability, simplicity and accuracy.},
